English | Indonesian
## Background

As of July 18, 2021, the Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) pandemic has hit Indonesia in the 16 months since the Indonesian government announced the discovery the first two cases of Covid-19 on March 2, 2020. Since then, various efforts have been made both by the central government and local governments to reduce the rate of spread and Covid-19 fatalities. This pandemic has also caused several local governments to implement Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) policies that have implications for restrictions community activities, including economic activities, and other social activities.

The decrease in various activities due to various social restrictions has an impact on the condition of socio-economic community, especially the vulnerable and poor. Therefore, government, both at the central and regional levels, issued various policies to tackling the spread of COVID-19 as well as policies that are response to the social and economic impacts of this pandemic. Nevertheless, implementation of these various policies needs to be monitored and evaluated to find out its effectiveness. Therefore, a statistical comparative study is conducted in this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to further investigate of the impact of the pandemic towards the income per capita, life expectancy, poverty severity level, and poverty depth level in communities across 34 provinces in Indonesia.

## Results

The community's economic growth rate can be reflected in the variable of community expenditure per capita. The Expenditure per Capita variable is a variable which capable of reflecting indicators of people's income and describing the level of welfare enjoyed by the population as an output from the improving economy. From the results of the analysis that has been carried out, it is found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the level of community economic growth. This is indicated by the decline in Adjusted Expenditures per Capita in the transition from 2019 to 2020 as well as distribution analysis which also shows a decrease in skewness between the pre-pandemic period and the pandemic period due to a significant reduction in public spending during the pandemic. In absolute value, the average level of community economic growth during the pandemic was still relatively significantly higher than conditions before the pandemic. This is the result of the trend before the pandemic which did show a consistent positive trend. However, it should be noted that when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there was a slowdown in growth and even a decline (in the 2019-2020 period) the economic level of the community when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. This means that the community's economic growth rate is negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Life Expectancy at Birth (UHH) still has an increasing trend during the pandemic (2019-2021) even though its growth is slowing. However, it is interesting to see that there has also been a decrease in the standard deviation of Life Expectancy at Birth (UHH) in 34 provinces in Indonesia during the pandemic. It means that despite the slowdown in growth, the gap in the Life Expectancy at Birth (UHH) between provinces in Indonesia has actually improved during the pandemic. From the results of statistical testing, it was also found that there was a significant increase in the average life expectancy at birth.

Meanwhile, the poverty level of the community has had a negative impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the absolute value of the poverty level of the community as indicated by the average severity and depth index of poverty is still lower than the pre-pandemic period. This is again the result of the trend before the pandemic which did show a consistent trend of decreasing poverty levels. However, what is far more important to note is that when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there was a change in the trend of people's poverty levels which not only experienced a slowdown, but also a decreasing trend. It means that in general the pandemic has had a negative impact on the poverty level of communities across Indonesia.
